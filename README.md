# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ronish29/To-Do-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd To-Do-App
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App Locally

After installing the dependencies, you can run the app locally by executing the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the source code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need to customize the build tools or configuration, you can run `npm run eject`. This will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing for full customization. Be cautious, as this action cannot be undone.
